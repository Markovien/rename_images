# rename_images
Rename a set of images

This is a small program to rename images with a particular nomenclature.
ex : you want your images names be like 'xxx_image_example.jpg'.
with a big set of images, it will be too annoying to do that manually.

# this program is customizable as you want for renaming others files.

I hope you will enjoy ^^ !
